<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Reduce flood damage and keep people safe by acting <em>before</em> water rises, moving early, and recovering with proper decontamination.</p>

<h2>Scenario (Example)</h2>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> 10–15 cm of rain forecast in 24 hours; river already high. Basement has a history of seepage. You may need to evacuate by evening.</p>

<h2>Before (6–24 Hours Out)</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Protect Utilities.</strong> Raise appliances off the floor. Shut off breakers to basement outlets if needed. Test sump pump and verify battery backup.</li>
  <li><strong>Barriers.</strong> Stack sandbags in a “U” with plastic sheeting toward water. Overlap seams like shingles. Keep doorways clear for exit.</li>
  <li><strong>Move Valuables.</strong> Elevate boxes and electronics. Put documents in waterproof bags.</li>
  <li><strong>Vehicle.</strong> Park on higher ground facing out. Keep the tank at least half full.</li>
  <li><strong>Comms & Routes.</strong> Check alerts; identify two ways out that don’t cross low spots.</li>
</ol>

<h2>During</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Leave early if evacuation is advised. Don’t wait for knee-deep water.</li>
  <li><strong>Never</strong> drive through moving water. “Turn Around, Don’t Drown.” 30 cm can move a car.</li>
  <li>If trapped upstairs, move to the highest interior room; avoid attics without exits. Signal from windows with lights or bright cloth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>After (Recovery)</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Safety First.</strong> Assume water is contaminated (sewage, fuel). Wear gloves, boots, and an N95. Shut power at the main before entering a wet area.</li>
  <li><strong>Document.</strong> Take photos/video before cleanup for insurance. Keep receipts.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove Water & Mud.</strong> Pump gradually (no more than 1/3 at a time to protect walls). Shovel mud; hose from clean to dirty areas.</li>
  <li><strong>Dry & Disinfect.</strong> Remove soaked drywall below the waterline. Run fans/dehumidifiers; disinfect hard surfaces with proper solutions.</li>
  <li><strong>Mold Clock.</strong> 24–48 hours is the window—get materials drying fast.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Real Example</h2>
<p>A homeowner with a battery-backed sump kept water to 2–3 cm during a flash flood, saving the furnace. Because they parked on the street crown, the car stayed dry and became the family’s mobile power/comm hub.</p>

<h2>Checklist</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Sump pump + battery backup tested</li>
  <li>Sandbags + plastic sheeting</li>
  <li>Work gloves, boots, N95, bleach/cleaners</li>
  <li>Photos of rooms for “before” reference</li>
  <li>Go-bags and evacuation route plan</li>
</ul>

<h2>Contingencies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Water rising faster than pumps → cut power, grab go-bags, go to higher ground immediately.</li>
  <li>Gas smell or electrical arcing → evacuate and call utility from outside.</li>
  <li>No help for 24 h → conserve batteries; prioritize drying and documentation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>After-Action</h2>
<p>Update grading and gutters; install backflow valves; raise outlets or appliances; keep sandbags staged before the next season.</p>
