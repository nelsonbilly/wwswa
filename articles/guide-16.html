<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Build a vehicle kit that keeps people warm, hydrated, visible, and communicating during breakdowns or closures in <em>any season</em>. Your priorities are safety off the traffic lane, shelter from weather, and a plan to signal or self-recover.</p>

<h2>Scenario (Example)</h2>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Highway closed by ice after dark. You have half a tank of fuel, two passengers, weak cell coverage, and temperatures dropping below −10°C. Tow ETA is “unknown.”</p>

<h2>Kit Layout (By Function)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>People:</strong> wool blankets or sleeping bags, spare hats/gloves, chemical warmers, 3 L water/person, high-calorie bars, electrolyte packets.</li>
  <li><strong>Shelter/Heat/Cool:</strong> wool blanket or bivy per seat, reflective windshield cover (insulation), small tarp + cord to rig shade in summer.</li>
  <li><strong>Comms/Light:</strong> phone charger (12V + USB-C), power bank, FRS/GMRS handheld (if convoying), AM/FM radio, headlamps (one per seat), road flares or LED beacons, triangle reflectors.</li>
  <li><strong>Recovery/Repair:</strong> full-size spare (or space-saver inflated), jack + base plate, lug wrench, aerosol tire sealant, plug kit + 12V compressor, jump starter, tow strap with rated hooks, duct tape, zip ties, basic tool roll.</li>
  <li><strong>Admin/Safety:</strong> high-vis vests, nitrile gloves, first-aid kit (pressure bandage, gauze, meds), paper map, cash, copy of insurance/roadside numbers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Placement Map</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Driver door pocket: headlamp, high-vis vest, window breaker/seatbelt cutter.</li>
  <li>Under front seat: first-aid kit, nitrile gloves.</li>
  <li>Trunk left: tool roll, jack, base plate, plug kit, compressor.</li>
  <li>Trunk right: blankets/bivies, water, food, tarp.</li>
  <li>Top access: triangles/flares be the first thing you reach.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step-by-Step: Breakdown on Shoulder</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Position & protect (1 min).</strong> Pull as far off the lane as possible; wheels turned away from traffic; hazards on.</li>
  <li><strong>Mark the scene (2–3 min).</strong> Put on a high-vis vest. Place a triangle 10 m behind in city, 30–50 m on highway. In rain/ice, increase distance.</li>
  <li><strong>Assess & decide (2 min).</strong> Flat? Fuel? Battery? Temperature? Time to service? Decide: fix now or shelter-in-car and call for help.</li>
  <li><strong>Comms (ongoing).</strong> Send exact location: mile marker, nearest exit, GPS lat/long. Text rather than call to save battery. If radios in a convoy, agree on a channel now.</li>
  <li><strong>If fixing a flat (10–15 min).</strong> Jack on solid base (use a wood block), chock opposite tire, loosen lugs before lifting, keep body out from lane side. Re-torque after 50–100 km.</li>
  <li><strong>If staying put (overnight).</strong> Crack a downwind window 1 cm for ventilation. Run engine 10–15 minutes each hour for heat <em>after</em> checking the tailpipe is clear of snow. Rotate watch/sleep schedule.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Seasonal Modules</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Winter:</strong> shovel, traction boards or sand, candle-in-a-can (heat source with venting), insulated bottle, extra socks.</li>
  <li><strong>Summer:</strong> extra 4–6 L water, electrolyte tabs, wide-brim hat, reflective tarp for shade, sunscreen.</li>
  <li><strong>Monsoon/Wet:</strong> rain ponchos, microspikes for slick shoulders, larger base plate for the jack.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Real Example</h2>
<p>A family stranded during a mountain pass closure rotated engine heat 15 minutes/hour, placed triangles 50 m and 100 m back due to curves, and shared a thermos of hot cocoa from a small stove in the back (window cracked, CO alarm on batteries). They slept in hats and bivies and were fine when the plows reopened at 05:30.</p>

<h2>Checklist</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Light per seat + spare batteries</li>
  <li>Triangles/flares; high-vis vests</li>
  <li>Water 3 L/person + electrolytes</li>
  <li>Blankets/bivies; hats/gloves</li>
  <li>Plug kit + compressor; jump starter; tow strap</li>
</ul>

<h2>Contingencies</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tailpipe buried:</strong> Dig it out before running engine; risk of CO poisoning.</li>
  <li><strong>No cell service:</strong> Write a note (time, names, plate, direction of travel) and leave on dash. If you must walk out, go in daylight on the <em>opposite</em> side of guardrail, wearing high-vis.</li>
  <li><strong>Heat illness risk:</strong> Shade first, then water and electrolytes. Rest during solar noon.</li>
</ul>

<h2>After-Action</h2>
<p>Replace used items immediately and log times: how long the plug kit took, how much fuel heat cycles consumed, what you wished you’d had. Adjust the kit for your climate.</p>
