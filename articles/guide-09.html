  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>Survive until pickup by prioritizing flotation, exposure control, and signaling while minimizing drift from your last known position. Don’t “swim for it.” Make yourself big, bright, and predictable to rescuers.</p>

  <h2>Scenario (Example)</h2>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> Two adults in a 16-ft center-console lose power 3 nm offshore on a rising afternoon sea. Batteries sag, cell service flickers. There’s a Type-IV throw cushion, two PFDs, a whistle, flares, and a small cooler. Weather shows a sea breeze increasing and a late squall line.</p>

  <h2>Step-by-Step</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Stabilize the platform (5 min).</strong> Distribute weight evenly to prevent capsize. If swamped but vessel floats, <em>stay with the boat</em>—it’s the biggest, most visible thing you have. Tie off anyone in the water to a bow or stern cleat with a short line.</li>
    <li><strong>HEAT: Hypothermia/Exposure/Alert/Targets (10 min).</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Hypothermia:</em> Get as much body out of water as possible—climb partly across gunwale, cooler, or cushion. Huddle if multiple people. Wear PFDs properly.</li>
        <li><em>Exposure:</em> Rig shade with a towel/poncho and boat hook. Cover head/neck. Prevent sunburn and evaporative chill.</li>
        <li><em>Alert:</em> Turn on any EPIRB/PLB immediately. If you have VHF, hail <strong>“Pan-Pan”</strong> on Ch 16 with position (lat/long, bearing to land, depth, landmarks). If GPS is dead, read compass and estimate distance from last waypoint.</li>
        <li><em>Targets:</em> Don’t drift aimlessly. If safe, anchor to reduce leeway; otherwise deploy a makeshift drogue (bucket on a line) from the bow to keep the bow into waves and slow drift.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Signal schedule (throughout).</strong> Conserve flares for line-of-sight assets (boats/helicopters) within a 1–2 minute approach window. Day: mirror, bright cloth, waving arms in slow deliberate motions. Night: strobe/flashlight in <em>SOS</em> (••• — — — •••). Use the whistle <em>three short blasts</em> every few minutes when you see traffic.</li>
    <li><strong>Water & heat (hourly).</strong> Ration sips, not gulps. Shade matters more than you think—your sweat rate drops when you’re not baking. Do <em>not</em> drink seawater. If rain arrives, collect with clean plastic or a shirt stretched as a catch surface.</li>
    <li><strong>Drift management (every 30–60 min).</strong> Note the sun’s position and wave sets to estimate drift direction. Tie a bright object (towel or spare line) as a “tail” so you can see your relative motion. If a squall is approaching and you can’t anchor, tighten the drogue line to keep the bow up-sea.</li>
    <li><strong>Crew care (every 20–30 min).</strong> Check for seasickness, dehydration, or panic. Swap positions (shade vs. sun) and rehearse what each person does when a rescue boat is sighted—<em>one signals, one keeps the boat stable</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>Night routine.</strong> Consolidate everyone into the most stable, highest part of the hull. Lash loose items. Keep the strobe/flashlight ready and cover it to preserve night vision. Agree on watch changes every 30–60 minutes.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Real Example</h2>
  <p>Three kayakers blown offshore in afternoon thermal winds linked up with a tow line, rafted beam-to-beam to create a wider radar/visual target, and used a mirror at sunset to hit a fishing boat on the horizon. They avoided the deadly “one tries to sprint in” mistake and were recovered within two hours.</p>

  <h2>Checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>People: PFDs on, head covered, hydration plan, buddy checks.</li>
    <li>Platform: stay with boat/debris, drogue/anchor set, bow to waves.</li>
    <li>Signals: EPIRB/PLB on, VHF Ch 16 calls, mirror/whistle/flares schedule.</li>
    <li>Nav: last known position noted, drift direction estimated.</li>
    <li>Admin: avoid fuel/chemical exposure; log times and actions with a marker on hull or cooler.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Contingencies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Capzise imminent:</strong> Everyone on one side; on “count of three” roll with the wave, don’t fight it. Stay together and hold onto the hull.</li>
    <li><strong>Storm line hits:</strong> Lash down; helmets/hats on; crouch low; keep bow to waves; ride it out. Lightning risk—avoid touching metal rails; keep limbs inside.</li>
    <li><strong>No signaling gear:</strong> Tear reflective labels, use foil from snack packs or can lids as mirrors; tie light-colored clothing high; form the international distress signal (three of anything: objects, waves, blasts).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>After-Action</h2>
  <p>Once ashore: hydrate, treat sun/wind burn, and document what failed (fuel line, battery maintenance, comms). Add a PLB, spare handheld VHF in a dry bag, proper drogue/sea anchor, and high-visibility panel to your kit. Schedule a practice “engine-out” drill next fair-weather weekend.</p>
